### GitHub finder
Hi! this is a React application to find GitHub users and list info available
in their profile.
• User displays data provided by the GitHub API (refer to the example provided).
• Use function components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useParams).
• Use react-router-dom features to redirect the user to the profile page.
• Use axios instead of fetch.
